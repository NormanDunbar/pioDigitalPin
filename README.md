# pioDigitalPin
This is one of the demo libraries for the article on [writing Arduino and AVR libraries](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/WritingLibraries) which I am currently writing (or have completed, depending on when you read this!). There are two libraries created for the article:

* [avrDigitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/avrDigitalPin) for both Arduino and PlatformIO, in the latter case, regardless of framework; and
* [digitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/digitalPin) for the Arduino IDE only (or PlatformIO using the Arduino framework).

This library, [pioDigitalPin](https://githuib.com/NormanDunbar/pioDigitalPin) is a conversion of the Arduino structure in [avrDigitalPin](https://github.com/NormanDunbar/avrDigitalPin) but purely for the PlatfromIO environment, not the Arduino IDE.
